ðŸ”¹ Basic Operations on Singly Linked List
1. Insertion
Inserting a node into the list.

At the beginning (head)

At the end (tail)

At a given position (index or after a specific value)

2. Deletion
Removing a node from the list.

From the beginning (head)

From the end (tail)

At a given position (by index or value)

3. Traversal
Visiting each node from head to end.

Used to display elements.

java
Copy
Edit
Node curr = head;
while (curr != null) {
    System.out.println(curr.data);
    curr = curr.next;
}
4. Search
Search for a node by value or position.

Returns node reference or position if found.

5. Update
Modify the value of a node (typically after finding it by value or position).

ðŸ”¹ Advanced Operations
6. Reverse the List
Reverse the list so the last node becomes the head.

Usually done using 3 pointers: prev, curr, and next.

7. Find Length
Count total nodes in the list.

8. Find Middle Node
Use slow and fast pointer approach to find the middle node in one pass.

9. Detect Loop (Cycle)
Use Floydâ€™s Cycle Detection Algorithm (Tortoise and Hare).

10. Remove Duplicates
If list is sorted, traverse and remove nodes with the same value.

11. Merge Two Sorted Lists
Merge two sorted singly linked lists into one sorted list.

12. Sort the List
Sort the list using Merge Sort or Bubble Sort (not efficient on linked list but possible).

13. Nth Node from End
Use two-pointer approach to find the nth node from the end in a single pass.

14. Check if Palindrome
Use a stack or reverse second half and compare.

15. Delete Entire List
Set head to null and optionally free memory in some languages (Java GC handles it).
